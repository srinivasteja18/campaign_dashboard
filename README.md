# Zocket Campaign App - Assignment Submission

### Website Link

https://zocket-campaign.netlify.app/

### Working 
- Starts with Campaign Dashboard
- User can filter the Camapign based on `Platform`  `Status`.
- User can create a Camapaign
- Users can choose options and proceed to next step.

### Assumptions and Expectations
- Focused mainly on Frontend part
- Only `Campaign` tab is implemented for `desktop` (As design is only provided for this)
- No backend/API calls are involved
- Creating campaign doesnot add a new campaign in Dashboard (just implemented logic of how user can choose the options while creating)
- Top navigation bar fields are not selectable
